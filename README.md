# JPMC Task 1
Starter repo for task 1 of the JPMC software engineering program

Steps:
- Making changes in `client3.py`
The changes made are in the following methods of the file
• getDataPoint
   modifies this function to compute the right stock price. This means change how `price` is computed by using the formula: (bid_price+ask_price) / 2.
• getRatio
  this method just returned 1 all the time. This is corrected changing the return value to the ratio of stock price_a to stock price_b
• Main
  it's just a matter of printing the correct values.
